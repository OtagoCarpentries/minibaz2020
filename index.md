# MiniBaz 2020
#### Monday June 22nd - Thursday June 25th

Welcome to MiniBaz2020 (the COIVD19 version of [Research Bazaar](https://otagocarpentries.github.io/resbaz2019/dunedin/)). This year we are running a selection of stand-alone workshops to pick and chose from. Session will be targetted towards a molecular biology/genetics background with one in the morning then one in the afternoon. You don't need to sign up for everything, only those workshops that interest you. 

These worshops are designed as _tasters_ rather than being comprehensive on the given topics.

Sign up is at the bottom of the page [link]()

### Intro to R
This session uses the Carpentries, Introduction to R [lessons](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html) It is aimed at beginner users of R, who have little to no experience using R.

**Useful prior knowledge** = NONE  


By attending this workshop, learners should come away understanding:

- Basic operations and syntax of R
- How to call functions.
- Find how to get help.
- Create scripts for code reuse.

##### Learning Objectives
* Define the following terms as they relate to R: 
    - object, assign, call, function, arguments, options.
* Assign values to objects in R.
* Learn how to name objects
* Use comments to inform script.
* Call functions and use arguments to change their default options.
* Inspect the content of vectors and manipulate their content.
* Subset and extract values from vectors.

### Manipulating Data / Visualising Data
This workshop introduces how to use R for manipulating datasets, and the beginning of plotting data. It is expected that attendees would have an understanding of basic R syntax (such as by attending the Intro to R workshop).

**Useful prior knowledge** = Intro to R or equivalent  

Lessons can be found at
* [Manipulating Data Frames with ```dplyr```](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html)
* [Data Visualisation with ```ggplot2```](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html)

### Introduction to Bash/Shell Scripting

This workshop aims to introduce the use of the Unix shell for the purposes of increasing reproducibility of tasks.

[The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) 
Useful prior knowledge = NONE 

By attending this workshop, learners can expect to come away understanding

- How to navigate the Unix file system
- How to repeat tasks
- How to combine tasks together


##### Learning Objectives
* Files and Directories
* History and Tab Completion
* Pipes and Redirection
* Looping Over Files

---

### Genomic Data in R

This workshop will introduce R can be used with genomic data, specifically how to manipulate genomic regions, and the use of genomic annotations from external sources.

Useful prior knowledge = Intro to R or equivalent  

By attending this workshop, learners can expect to come away understanding:

- How to represent genomic regions in R
- How to find and access annotation information with R
- How to install R packages from Bioconductor

---

### REGEX (Regular Expressions)  
Practical Bash, using ```grep```, ```find``` and other tools to search and filter your data files on the command line
Useful prior knowldge = Intro to Bash or equivalent 

---

### HackMD / R Markdown

[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) is a realtime, multi-platform collaborative markdown knowledge base.
You can write notes with other people on your desktop, tablet or even on the phone.

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a tool for writing reproducible reports, document and presentations

---

### Reproducible Workflow
Useful prior knowledge = Intro to R or equivalent  

Example of a workflow tying together R, R-Studio and R Markdown to write a reproducuble report
  * Summarize Data
  * Plotting
  * References

---

### Snakemake
The [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses. Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language. They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition. Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a description of required software, which will be automatically deployed to any execution environment.
