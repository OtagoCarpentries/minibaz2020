This year we are running a selection of stand alone workshops to pick and chose from. Session will be targetted towards a molecular biology/genetics background with one in the morning then one in the afternoon. You don't need to sign up for everything, nly those workshops that interest you. 

Sign up is at the bottom of the page [link]()

Install instuctions for each of the workshop sessions are [HERE](https://github.com/OtagoCarpentries/minibaz2020/edit/master/setup.md)  

### Intro to R (1)
This session uses the Carpentries, Introduction to R [lessons](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html)

##### Learning Objectives
* Define the following terms as they relate to R: 
    - object, assign, call, function, arguments, options.
* Assign values to objects in R.
* Learn how to name objects
* Use comments to inform script.
* Call functions and use arguments to change their default options.
* Inspect the content of vectors and manipulate their content.
* Subset and extract values from vectors.

### Manipulating Data / Visualising Data (2)
Following on from Introduction to R with some manipulating of datasets and the beginning of plotting data.

Lessons can be found at
* [Manipulating Data Frames with ```dplyr```](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/03-dplyr.html)
* [Data Visualisation with ```ggplot2```](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/04-visualization-ggplot2.html)

### Introduction to Bash/Shell Scripting (1)
[The Unix Shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) 

##### Learning Objectives
* Files and Directories
* History and Tab Completion
* Pipes and Redirection
* Looping Over Files

### Genomic Data in R (2)
Using R

### REGEX (2)
Practical Bash, using ```grep```, ```find``` and other tools to search and filter your data files on the command line

### HackMD / R Markdown (2)

[HackMD](https://hackmd.io/) is a realtime, multi-platform collaborative markdown knowledge base.
You can write notes with other people on your desktop, tablet or even on the phone.

[R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a tool for writing reproducible reports, document and presentations

### Workflow (2)
Example of a workflow tying together R, R-Studio and R Markdown to write a reproducuble report
  * Summarize Data
  * Plotting
  * References

### Snakemake (3)
The [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses. Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language. They can be seamlessly scaled to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition. Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a description of required software, which will be automatically deployed to any execution environment.
